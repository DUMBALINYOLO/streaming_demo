    '''
        Any consumer based on Channelsâ€™ SyncConsumer or AsyncConsumer will 
        automatically provide you a self.channel_layer and self.channel_name attribute, 
        which contains a pointer to the channel layer instance and the channel name that 
        will reach the consumer respectively. Any message sent to that channel name - or 
        to a group the channel name was added to - will be received by the consumer much 
        like an event from its connected client, and dispatched to a named method on the 
        consumer. The name of the method will be the type of the event with periods replaced 
        by underscores
